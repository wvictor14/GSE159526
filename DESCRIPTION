Description: 
    19 term and 9 first trimester placental chorionic villi and matched
    cell-sorted samples ran on Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC DNA methylation
    microarrays. This data was made available on GEO accession
    [GSE159526](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159526).
    Both the raw and processed data has been made available on
    \code{ExperimentHub}. Raw unprocessed data formatted as an RGChannelSet 
    object for integration and normalization using minfi and other existing 
    Bioconductor packages. Processed normalized data is also available as a DNA 
    methylation \code{matrix}, with a corresponding phenotype information as a
    \code{data.frame} object.
